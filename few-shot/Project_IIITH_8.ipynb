      "1. Added a comma after \"I found the buyer,\" to separate two independent clauses.\n",

      "The error in your sentence is due to the incorrect use of the past tense form of \"wake\". To correct it, you should use \"woke up\" instead of \"waked up\".\n",

      "Here's a tip for remembering this: The irregular verb \"wake\" has a regular past participle form, which is \"woken\". However, when using it in the present perfect tense (e.g., \"I have woken up\"), you should use the base form \"woke\". To help remember this, think of the regular past participle as an exception to the rule for irregular verbs.\n",
